# Investigate Dataset

### Overview of the project

For this project, data analysis was conducted using Pandas and NumPy. Inferential statistics or machine learning was not used in this project. This project is open-ended in that there's no looking for one right answer.



### Notes

The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS is used by todetermine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isnâ€™t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase. The data has been supplemented with state level data from [census.gov]( https://www.census.gov/).
